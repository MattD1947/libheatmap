Project description:
Create a visual heatmap for the LCSC library
- The program must use a visual map for the first and the second floor
- As the number of entries on a location increases, the color on the map must also change
- An easy to use and effective GUI, streamlined.
- No extra features needed. Focus on just what is presented.

Current agenda:
- Redrawing the map to accomadate program and improve realistic accuracy
- Binding GUI cordinates into location variables so that we can color over location
- Make a second page of the GUI for the second floor
- Improve user feedback/interface response (currently there is no indication that hitting enter will change the value)

Extra notes:
- Brainstorming design ideas are welcomed. 
- As long as the solution to the problem is addressed effectively, what we use does not matter.
- If an idea is a better solution, there is no issue with rewriting everything.
- The code that I have right now is what worked for me when I started on this program alone.
